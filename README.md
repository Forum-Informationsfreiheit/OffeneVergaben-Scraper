# OffeneVergaben
OffeneVergaben.at

Here, you will find the code and documentation of the OffeneVergaben.at, a platform that will scrape, aggregate, analyse and visualise open data on public procurement of authorities, state entities and state-owned companies in Austria. 

The platform will focus in particular on data on the award of contracts. 

This project is made possible by support from Netidee (https://www.netidee.at/).

More information on the project is available at https://www.netidee.at/offene-vergaben (in German).
